# Double Vertical Slider

A sleek, full-page vertical slider built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project, inspired by the "50 Projects in 50 Days" course, features two panes that slide in opposite directions simultaneously, creating a visually engaging effect.

## Features

*   **Dual Sliding Panels:** A content panel (left) and an image panel (right) slide in opposite directions.
*   **Responsive Design:** The slider adapts to the full viewport height and width.
*   **Smooth Animations:** Utilizes CSS transitions with a custom `cubic-bezier` timing function for a polished, "techy" feel.
*   **Simple Navigation:** Easy-to-use up and down buttons for slide navigation.
*   **Dynamic Sizing:** JavaScript ensures the slider remains perfectly aligned even when the browser window is resized.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript:** No external libraries or frameworks are required, making it lightweight and easy to understand.
