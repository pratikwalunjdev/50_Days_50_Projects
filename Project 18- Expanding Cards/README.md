# Expanding Cards

A sleek, animated image gallery where clicking a panel expands it to reveal the full image and title. This project is part of the "50 Projects in 50 Days" challenge and showcases modern CSS techniques for a dynamic user interface.



## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive UI:** Click on any panel to expand it, while the others gracefully collapse.
- **Smooth Animations:** Fluid transitions powered by CSS `flex`, `transform`, and `opacity`.
- **Dark & Stylish Theme:** A modern, tech-inspired dark mode aesthetic with a subtle overlay effect.
- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to smaller screens, hiding non-essential panels for a clean mobile experience.
- **Pure Vanilla JS:** Lightweight and dependency-free, with clean and simple event handling.
- **CSS Custom Properties:** Easily customizable theme (colors, timings, etc.) through CSS variables.
